                    Though I haven&apos;t been actively building software for clients lately, I have been learning many new technologies, studying design patterns, and working on a couple side projects like this one. I am fascinated by software
                    architecture and system design, and I intend to continue learning and growing in this area.

                    <br />
                    In my professional capacity, I work daily with Dotnet Core, SQL Server, React, React Native, Redis, and Docker/Kubernetes with various cloud platforms. I also get the chance to work with Typescript from time to time, which I love.
                    <br />
                    <br />I am committed to continuing to improve my skills, write cleaner code, and learn new technologies. (and make more frequent commits ðŸ˜¬)
